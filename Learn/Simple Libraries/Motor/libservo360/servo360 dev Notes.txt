To-Do: 


  [  ] Right wheel losing a tick

  [  ] Set up pulse windows for 6 or 8 servos
  [  ] Add overflow resets for the 12-bit angle tracking approaching 31 bits
  [  ] Transition between speed and position control 
  [  ] Slow down faster wheel at top speed

  [  ] Add control system setting functions
  [  ] Test more servos

  [  ] Clean variable names
  [  ] Clean function names
  
  [  ] Documentation comments
  [  ] Code comments

  [  ] Make feedback work sans encoders


Reminders:

  Test feedback
  Temporarily change rampstep and topspeed in drive_goto
  Check how the servo handles stalls
  Check for functions that call other functions and might set locks twice
  Check for rounding down error in goto
  AB Interpreter doesn't run properly if #define _console_
  Check to make sure repeated same speed calls don't change control accumulators


Tests:

 [ pass ] Test Encoder Connections.side
 [ pas* ] AB Interpreter.side
          * It does not pass if _console_ is #defined for debugging
 [ pass ] Forward Stop Face Right.side

 [ fail ] Speeds for Navigation.side
          Examine IR Bot for overshoot
          Check Ping Bot against others for left servo lag
            IR Bot did not have the same problem as Ping Bot

 [  na  ] Test Ping.side
 [ pass ] Detect and Turn from Obstacle.side
 [ pass ] Roaming with Ping.side
          In ...Documents\SimpleIDE\My Projects\Additional abdrive360 Tests
 [ fail ] Follow with Ping.side
          The application worked, but the servo missmatch is very visible.

 [  na  ] Test Whiskers with Terminal.side
 [  na  ] Test Whiskers with LEDs.side
 [ fail ] Whiskers Push Bot.side
          Application passed, but servos were missmatched at certain speeds
 [ fial ] Roaming with Whiskers.side
          Either servoLeft too slow periodically, or servoRight too fast periodically  

 [ test ] Test Light Sensors.side
 [ test ] Test Light Sensors Graphical.side
 [ test ] Navigate by Light.side

 [ test ] Test IR Detectors.side
 [ test ] IR Roaming.side

 [ test ] drive_goto tests.side
 [ test ] drive_speed tests.side


Notes:

   Open Loop Acceleration-360
   
   alphaMax approx (40 degrees / s) / (1/50/s) = 2000 degrees/s^2
